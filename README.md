## Basic R Code
Hi Everyone! This is a short introduction to coding with R. 

### Getting Started

First we need to download R. You can do this at the following [Link](https://cran.uni-muenster.de/bin/windows/base/R-4.0.0-win.exe)

Next, we must learn some of the basics of R code. First, R can act as a calculator. For example:

```markdown
2 + 4
```

Try **running** this code, which you can do with ctrl + enter or by hitting the Green "Run Button" (see image below) ![Green Button](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/1dONBYph1LF8aiE4xD98UMlYzWAfvVqKRQ_JJRf-9EscdKI-3R3HSI_8TIVVG3PWOzK0Rad1qIxsaTbSuI1K7BcEQwGkU2_WMr5S1vE7w7qVYCpn_RA)

This line of code should print the number 6 located in the "Script Results" section 

```
[1] 6
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jolcott24/Practice-Website/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
